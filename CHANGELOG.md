### Added

- Reorganized the PyQt desktop interface into the `ui/` package while retaining
  its public import surface.

  WCAG contrast checks.
- Added desktop and responsive web console interfaces, plus screenshot
  evidence for their states, settings, authentication, onboarding, and reduced
  motion.
- Expanded CI to run the complete Python test suite in headless Qt mode.
- Added desktop, hosted API, and development dependency profiles.

### Changed

- Updated the README clone command to use `anonymandk/jarvis` and added desktop
  and web previews.
- Rewrote `DESIGN.md` to describe the implemented shared tokens, layouts,
  accessibility, motion, and runtime-signal limits.
- Expanded contributor instructions with Python QA, web build, and screenshot
  commands.
- Moved the awareness-engine note into `docs/` and linked it from the one-line
  memory index.

### Audited

  [`docs/ui/REALITY_CHECK_F6.md`](docs/ui/REALITY_CHECK_F6.md). Tool execution
  behavior was not changed by the audit.
